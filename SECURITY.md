# Security Policy

## Supported Scope
- Latest `main` branch
- Latest tagged release artifacts

## Reporting a Vulnerability
1. Do not open public issues for unpatched vulnerabilities.
2. Report details privately to project maintainers through your hosting platform's private security reporting channel.
3. Include:
   - affected component/file
   - impact and attack path
   - reproduction steps
   - suggested fix (if available)

## Handling Guidelines
- Acknowledge report receipt promptly.
- Validate and triage severity.
- Patch with tests and release notes.
- Disclose publicly after fix availability.

## Release Verification
- Release artifacts include `*.sha256` sidecars generated by `tools/release.py`.
- Optional: CI can produce detached GPG signatures for the checksum sidecars. Workflow: `.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml` (job `Sign Checksums (Optional)`). Output: `UsnPw-signatures` artifact containing `*.sha256.asc` and `usnpw-release-publickey.asc`.
- Optional: CI can sign GHCR container images using cosign keyless signing. Workflow: `.github/workflows/container-ghcr.yml` (manual runs can opt in; tag signing can be enabled via `USNPW_COSIGN_SIGN=true` repository variable).
